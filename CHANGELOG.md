## 0.7.0

### BREAKING CHANGES

- A special `$script` key has been introduced with a neat üí™ platform recognition feature.

  Do you work on multiple platforms? Need to use many different commands and always forget which one to use? This is what you've been waiting for!

  ```yaml
  scripts:
    where-am-i:
      $script:
        $windows: echo "You are on Windows!"
        $linux: echo "You are on Linux!"
        $macos: echo "You are on MacOs!"
        $default: echo "You are on... something else?"
  ```

  ```
  user@MacBook-Pro Desktop % rps where-am-i
  > where-am-i
  $ echo "You are on MacOs!"

  You are on MacOs!

  user@MacBook-Pro Desktop %
  ```

  This can be useful for commands like `rm -rf`, which in Windows.... `rd /s /q`, you know what I mean, it can be helpful, right?

- Added support for script references. From now on it is possible to call another rps command directly from a defined script.

  ```yaml
  scripts:
    app:
      clean: flutter clean
    clean: $app clean
    c: $clean
    clear: $c
    delete: $clear
  ```

  This is just a simple proxy example, but you can also use it in `$before` and `$after` hooks to chain multiple scripts together.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è The `before-` and `after-` hooks has been removed. Instead use the `$before` and `$after` keys. This will help keep hook scripts grouped in a project with multiple scripts defined.

  ```yaml
  scripts:
    hooks:
      $before: echo "before"
      $script: echo "script"
      $after: echo "after"
  ```

  Execute by calling the `rps hooks`.

  It is also possible to link multiple scripts together!

  ```yaml
  scripts:
    get: flutter pub get
    test:
      $before: $get
      $script: flutter test
    build:
      $before: $test
      $script: flutter build apk
  ```

  You don't have to worry about cyclic references, RPS will keep track of them and notify you in case of a problem.
