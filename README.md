RPS is a dart script manager that allows you to define and use scripts from the _pubspec.yaml_ file.

## Quick start üöÄ

1. Install this package.
    ```bash
    dart pub global activate rps --version 0.8.0-dev.3
    ```
2. Define scripts inside the pubspec.yaml
      ```yaml
      scripts:
        gen: flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
      ```
3. Use your custom command.
    ```bash
    rps gen
    # you can also provide additional arguments
    rps gen --verbose
    ```
4. Safe a time and become a power user! üòà
    
    Less time typing long commands more time watching funny cats. üêà

# Features

## ü™Ü Nesting

Nest your commands to group them contextually and make them easier to understand.

```yaml
scripts:
  build:
    web: flutter build web --flavor production -t lib/main.dart
    android:
      apk: flutter build apk --flavor production -t lib/main.dart
      appbundle: flutter build appbundle --flavor production -t lib/main.dart
    ios:
      ipa: flutter build ipa --flavor production -t lib/main.dart
      ios: flutter build ios --flavor production -t lib/main.dart
```

Use with ease üòè

```
rps build android apk
```

## üîó References

Sometimes you may want to create a command alias (eg. a shorter version of it) or simply pass the execution of a hook to another command. This is where references come to the rescue! ‚õë

References are defined as a scripts that must begin with `rps` prefix.

```yaml
scripts:
  generator:
    build: flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
    watch: flutter pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs
  # short aliases:
  gb: rps generator build
  # They will not trigger an additional rps process.
  gw: rps generator watch
```

References can also be used with `$before` and `$after` hooks.

## ü™ù Hooks


To enable hooks define the `$before` and/or `$after` keys for your script command.

```yaml
scripts:
  hello:
    $before: echo "hello before" # executed before the $script
    $script: echo "hello script"
    $after: echo "hello after" # executed after $script
```

All hooks will be executed in the specified order when calling the `rps hello` command.

You can also combine multiple scripts using references!

```yaml
scripts:
  get: flutter pub get
  test:
    # equivalent of "rps run get"
    $before: $get
    $script: flutter test
  build:
    # equivalent of "rps run test"
    $before: $test
    $script: flutter build apk
```

You can also nest hooks to provide an easy-to-read workflow for all grouped commands!

```yaml
# Order when executing: "rps generator build"
scripts:
  generator:
    $before: dart pub get # 1.
    $after: dart analyze # 5.
    build:
      $before: echo "Building JSON models..." # 2.
      $script: dart pub run build_runner build # 3.
      $after: echo "JSON models built successfully..." # 4.
```

You don't have to worry about cyclic references üîÑ, RPS will keep track of them and notify you in case of a problem üòè.

## üíª Platform specific scripts

Do you work on multiple platforms? Need to use many different commands and always forget which one to use? This is what you've been waiting for! üõ†

Just use one command on all supported platforms üí™.

```yaml
scripts:
  where-am-i:
    $script:
      $windows: echo "You are on Windows!"
      $linux: echo "You are on Linux!"
      $macos: echo "You are on MacOs!"
      $default: echo "You are on... something else?"
```

```
user@MacBook-Pro Desktop % rps where-am-i
> where-am-i
$ echo "You are on MacOs!"

You are on MacOs!
```

This can be useful for commands like `rm -rf`, which in Windows.... `rd /s /q`, you know what I mean, it can be helpful, right?

## üéØ Positional arguments

Arguments can be passed by adding them to the end of the command Ôºç simple, but sometimes it is useful to give them in a specific place, here positional arguments come to the rescue.

Positional arguments are defined as numbers in parentheses: `${0}`, `${1}`, `${3}` and so on....

For example, you can use the following command to specify the target to be built.

```yaml
scripts:
  build: flutter build ${0} -t lib/main.dart --release
```

Now just run `rps build apk`.  

You can still add trailing arguments, such as `rps build apk --flavor funny` what will execute the following command `flutter build apk -t lib/main.dart --release --flavor funny`.

## üîé Overview example

```yaml
name: my_great_app
version: 1.0.0

scripts:
  # run is a default script. To use it, simply type
  # in the command line: "rps" - that's all!
  run: "flutter run -t lib/main_development.dart --flavor development"
  # you can define more commands like this: "rps gen"
  gen: "flutter pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs"
  # and even nest them!
  build:
    # You can use hooks to! (and even nest them!)
    $before: flutter pub get
    $after: echo "Build done!"
    android:
      # rps build android apk
      apk: 
        $before: echo "Building android apk..."
        $script: "flutter build --release apk --flavor production"
      # rps build android appbundle
      appbundle: "flutter build --release appbundle --flavor production"
      # and so on...
  # too long command? no problem! define alias using reference syntax!
  bab: rps build android appbundle
  # as simple as typing "rps baa"
  baa: rps build android apk
  # some commands may vary from platform to platform
  # but that's not a problem
  clear:
    # use the $script key to define platform specific scripts
    $script:
      # define the default script
      $default: rm -rf ./app/cache
      # And different script for the windows platform.
      $windows: rd /s /q app\cache
      # now "rps clear" will work on any platform!
  # want to run multi line script, here is an example
  reset: |
    flutter clean 
    flutter pub get

  # the rest of your pubspec file...
dependencies:
  path: ^1.7.0
```

## üìà Motivation

I got bored of typing the same long commands over and over again... I even got bored of pressing that boring (and even small on a MacBook) up arrow key to find my previous command in history. So, as befits a programmer, to save time, I spent more time writing this library than searching/writing commands for the last year...

Hey you! This package is still in development (errors and API changes can still occur üêõüòè).
